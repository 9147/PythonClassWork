'''
Create an object-oriented program that allows you to enter data for customers and
employees.
Problem Details

Create a Person class that provides attributes for first name, last name, and emailaddress. This
class should provide a property or method that returns the personâ€™s fullname.
Create a Customer class that inherits the Person class. This class should add anattribute for a
customer number.
Create an Employee class that inherits the Person class. This class should add anattribute for a
PAN number.
The program should create a Customer or Employee object from the data entered bythe user,
and it should use this object to display the data to the user. To do that, theprogram can use the
isinstance() function to check whether an object is a Customer orEmployee object.
